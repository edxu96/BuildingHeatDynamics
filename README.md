# MatrixTSA: Multivariate Time Series Analysis in Matrix

![](./images/tangram_1.png)

## How to Use

The input and output from observations of some dynamic process can always be combined to a matrix, which we call `mat_oi`. For outputs with uni-variate time series, there are only two columns in the matrix. For those with multivariate time series, it's convenient to see the data in matrix.

```
mat_oi <- get_mat_oi(datf)
```
