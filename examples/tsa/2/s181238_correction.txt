Q1
1. 
2. - you should also give the mean of the process
3. "very different" what is different? what do they have in common?
4. - compare to what you know from how this process should look
5. - compare to what you know from how this process should look
6. - variances not given.

Q2
a) - variance of second prediciton is wrong. see Week 5, slides 28-29, or EQ 3.61 in the book, for how to compute variance of prediction errors
- You have to use the t-distribution to find the confidence intervals, because the variance of the noise was estimated from data (not given). see EQ.3.61 in the TSA book. 
- which values do you get out? The second prediction is at least wrong. 
b) - but why (based on physical knowledge...) is daily seasonalitiy to be expected?  we expect daily patterns in the usage of the office. (when people enter, co2 level increases)
c)

Q3
General:
- It is a good idea to calculate the ACF and PACF to a sufficient high lag to see how the
seasonal information in the ACF and PACF decays. In the reference solution the ACF
and PACF are calculated to lag 50 to cover four seasons. Three seasons could be OK
since we know the true model but less than that is insufficient.

3. + good you discuss what you cannot see.
4.  + good you discuss what you cannot see.

6. 
Stationarity and Seasonality: 
Summary:
+ good!

Q4
1. - you should indicate both the 5% and the 95% quantiles in the plots. 
2. - no, you should look at the width of the confidence interval or at the variance. You cannot tell just from the 95% quantile. You can also see from the distribution in the histogram (see x-axis values!!) that the spread is lower when phi is higher.
3. + good.
4. + nice addition with the qq plots
- "According to contour plots, the distribution of the estimations are more intense around true value if there are more simulation times." SO.. conclusion!
