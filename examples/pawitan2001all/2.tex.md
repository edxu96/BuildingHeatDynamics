## Exercise 2.2

$N$ runners participate in a marathon and they are each assigned a number from 1 to $N$. From one location we record the following participants:

```
218 88 264 33 368 236 294 116 9
```

Make a reasonable assumption about the data and draw the likelihood of $N$.

```
x_i <- c(218, 88, 254, 33, 368, 235, 294, 115, 9)
l <- function(seq_num, x_i){
    L <- seq_num
    for(i in 1:length(N)){
        L[i] <- prod(rep(1, length(x_i)) / seq_num[i]) * (max(x_i) <= seq_num[i])
    }
    L
}

seq_num <- seq(350,600)
ll <- l(seq_num, x_i)

plot(seq_num, ll / max(ll), type = "l")
```
