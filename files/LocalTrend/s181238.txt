Problem 1.1:
Good. You cover the important points.

Problem 1.2:
Rho is incorrect. I am not sure where the error is, but when you update rho, simply just put rho = cor(eps[-1], eps[-n]).
Throw in some more comments. Cut out your code and equations.
You also need to estimate var(Ti) and specifying the variance for Htot and gAsol in your covariance matrix.

Problem 1.3:
You have misunderstood the concept of a local trend. The trend you draw looks more like a global one.
You need to write your predictions down in a table.

Problem 1.4:
Stick to the task. You don't get credit for just doing something else.
The spatial heating is incorrect, and you need to specify the results in a table.

Over all:
Not good. Don't spend your time writing down equations. Cut out the code, it doesnt belong in a report. It belongs in appendix.
Rather spend your time fully understanding the topic. 

Score: 25.5
